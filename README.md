# CodeWayfinder

## 1. Project Description
With the increase in economic uncertainty following the pandemic, feeling secure in our jobs has become more important than ever. We want reassurance that our hard-earned skills are worth the time and effort, and we want to know what the industry will need in the future.

CodeWayfinder can help you stay ahead of the curve by allowing you to focus on the programming languages that are most relevant to your career goals. Our app gathers data through user participation in surveys, making the information up-to-date and reflective of current industry trends.

Future features that we envision for this web app to have is to automatically select the city where the user is from by obtaining their Geo IP so we can display the results that are most likely to be relevant to the userâ€™s interest. We also want to expand the data set by including more languages, tools, and more.
